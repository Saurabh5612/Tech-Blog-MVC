# Tech-Blog-MVC
# Description
We were asked to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This application follows MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

This application was built from scratch using Express Handlebars, MySQL, Sequelize, dotenv, and bcrypt. The CSS Framework used was Bulma.
# Usage
To run locally, after cloning repo and navigating to the root folder:

mysql -u root -p

source db/schema.sql

quit

npm run seeds

npm start
